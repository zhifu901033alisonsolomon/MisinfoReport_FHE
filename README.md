# MisinfoReport_FHE

An anonymous and privacy-preserving platform that allows the public to securely report misinformation in the field of public health.  
All reports are encrypted using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), enabling secure aggregation, clustering, and trend analysis without ever revealing the raw data.

---

## Overview

Public health misinformation spreads rapidly through social media and other online platforms, undermining trust in institutions and endangering lives.  
However, most reporting systems today either fail to protect the privacy of reporters or centralize control in ways that discourage participation.

**MisinfoReport_FHE** introduces a paradigm shift ‚Äî an anonymous public health misinformation reporting platform powered by **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**.  
With FHE, every report remains encrypted from submission to analysis, ensuring that **no one ‚Äî not even system administrators ‚Äî can read individual reports** while still allowing meaningful aggregation and classification.

---

## Why FHE Matters

Traditional encryption protects data *at rest* and *in transit*, but once data is decrypted for processing, privacy is lost.  
In contrast, **FHE allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data**, preserving confidentiality end-to-end.

In the context of misinformation reporting:

- **Individual privacy**: Reporters can safely submit sensitive content without identity exposure.  
- **Secure aggregation**: Statistical trends (e.g., frequency of misinformation types) are derived without accessing raw data.  
- **Integrity and trust**: Even the platform operators cannot tamper with or read individual reports.  
- **Public transparency**: Aggregate insights can be verified and shared without compromising individual anonymity.

This cryptographic foundation ensures that the fight against misinformation does not come at the cost of personal privacy.

## Key Features

### üß© Encrypted Reporting

- Every report (text, category, metadata) is encrypted locally before transmission.  
- The platform uses FHE-based aggregation for counting and clustering without decryption.  
- Zero-knowledge verification ensures submissions are valid and complete.

### üîç Topic Clustering & Trend Analysis

- Reports are automatically grouped by thematic similarity under FHE operations.  
- Statistical patterns such as regional misinformation surges are detected privately.  
- Time-series trend visualization supports public health researchers and journalists.

### ü§ù Support for Fact-Checking Agencies

- Aggregated, anonymized insights help identify emerging misinformation narratives.  
- Fact-checking partners can securely query encrypted datasets without compromising privacy.  
- API interfaces allow integration with existing media monitoring pipelines.

### üß† Machine Learning on Encrypted Data

- Encrypted embeddings are used to cluster misinformation topics.  
- Differential privacy noise ensures statistical anonymity in learning results.  
- Researchers can analyze misinformation dynamics while maintaining full data confidentiality.

## System Architecture

### 1. Frontend Client

- Developed with **React** and **TypeScript** for performance and modularity.  
- Handles all client-side encryption and FHE key management.  
- Allows users to submit, view aggregated insights, and monitor category-level statistics.

### 2. Encrypted Storage Layer

- All submitted reports are stored in ciphertext form in decentralized storage.  
- Encrypted indices enable efficient search and retrieval.  
- No plaintext data is ever persisted or transmitted.

### 3. FHE Computation Engine

- Performs encrypted aggregation, clustering, and keyword frequency analysis.  
- Uses homomorphic addition and multiplication to compute counts and relationships.  
- Built with modern FHE libraries supporting batching and polynomial schemes.

### 4. Analytics Dashboard

- Presents only aggregated, privacy-preserving results.  
- Visualizes encrypted computation outputs such as category trends, misinformation intensity, and frequency heatmaps.  
- Includes access controls to prevent deanonymization through data triangulation.

## Security and Privacy

| Layer | Mechanism | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Encryption | Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) | Computation on encrypted data |
| Authentication | Zero-Knowledge Proofs | Validate report authenticity without revealing identity |
| Data Integrity | Immutable Ledger | Ensures reports cannot be altered post-submission |
| Access Control | Encrypted Query Interface | Only statistical queries permitted |
| Anonymity | No identifiable metadata | IP, device, or session data are discarded |

The platform‚Äôs architecture is **privacy-first by design**, not as an afterthought.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+  
- npm or yarn package manager  
- Modern web browser with WebAssembly support  
- Optional: local environment supporting FHE simulation (e.g., PyFHE or TFHE toolkit)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`  
3. Run local server: `npm run dev`
